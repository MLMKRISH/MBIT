Introduction

The power of Blockchain
“Blockchain, or distributed ledger technology, could soon give rise to a new era of the Internet even
more disruptive and transformative than the current one. Blockchain's ability to generate
unprecedented opportunities to create and trade value in society will lead to a generational shift in
the Internet's evolution, from an Internet of Information to a new generation Internet of Value.”
- World Economic Forum [1]
The first wave of the internet never fully fulfilled its promise of distributing wealth and authority
more evenly. The arrival of Blockchain technology has the potential to achieve this.
As we move towards going exclusively digital, there’s a rising need for security and transparency.
Blockchain networks allow digital users to cooperate and trade items of value directly with each
other, without any middlemen or intermediaries. This is because the system itself works as a
mechanism to create transparency and trust by virtue of its neutrality. Since there is no central
authority, abuse of power is prevented as power is decentralized and distributed.
Features of Blockchain
● Secure
● Transparent
● Peer to Peer transfer
● Encrypted and Pseudonymous
● Instant and frictionless transactions
● Low Cost
Simply put, it’s a code for creating trust.
In a blockchain system, the ledger is replicated in many identical databases, each hosted and
maintained by interested members(nodes). When changes are made in one ledger copy, all the
other copies get simultaneously updated. So as transactions occur, records of the value and assets
exchanged are permanently entered in all ledgers. No third-party intermediaries are required to
verify or transfer ownership.
A blockchain is operated by unidentified and unverified identities (i.e. we cannot know if it is a
person, a business, or a computer operating automatically, or something else — let alone understand
them to trust their choices and actions).
The lack of trust inherent in the blockchain system is overcome through consensus mechanisms.
Since any entity can add information to the blockchain (i.e. add data to the database), it is necessary
for the distributed members of the blockchain to assess and decide on agenda before they are
permanently merged immutably to the blockchain (the database). Since we are unsure of the
author’s honesty, it is vital that all new information must be checked and approved before being
committed. This “trust” is created using consensus mechanisms.

There are a few approaches of creating consensus in a blockchain: the proof-of-work
algorithm(PoW), the proof-of-stake algorithm (PoS), and the delegated proof-of-stake algorithm
(DPoS).
The most famous method of achieving consensus on a blockchain is the proof-of-work (PoW)
method, and is used by Bitcoin. PoW does not require all members(nodes) of the network to submit
their individual approvals to achieve consensus. Rather, PoW utilizes a ‘hash function’ to produce
conditions under which a single member is allowed to announce their decisions regarding the
information submitted, and those decisions can then be individualistically verified by all other
system members. Dishonest decisions are prevented by the parameters of the hash function, which
ensure that dishonest information will fail to compute in a suitable way. In the Bitcoin system, the
member who publicly approves the information on behalf of everyone is in turn rewarded for its
participation (PoW is costly in real terms of energy cost and computing resources) with newly
created (’mined’) Bitcoins. This process of searching for valid ‘hashes’ (solutions to the ‘hash
function’), is known as ‘mining’. Rewarding participation in the network ensures wider participation,
which helps creating a robust network and a safer blockchain (database).
Another method of achieving consensus on blockchain systems is developed such that involvement
in the consensus-achieving method is limited to entities acknowledged as having a sincere stake in
the blockchain. This method is called proof-of-stake (PoS) algorithms. Here the hash function
calculation is replaced with a digital signature which proves rights of the stake. The network selects
an entity to approve new information based on their relative stake in the network. In PoS, the
network mechanism runs a lottery and the lottery winner announces the results. The system
members automatically enter the lottery, relative to their total stake in the network as compared to
PoW where entities attempt to calculate valid hashes in order to be chosen to establish consensus.
NEO, Waves use variations of the PoW system to incentivize participation. Ethereum is also planning
to shift to PoS shortly.
These consensus mechanisms help to prevent hacks as hackers will have to simultaneously compete
with a huge number of honest system entities. This network effect helps in securing all the data on
Blockchain. Comparing this to a centralised institution which is vulnerable to hacks because the
hacker would require hacking into only one main system. This single point of control is also the
single point of failure, which can lead to disastrous security breaches. Distributing the ledger to
millions of nodes protects the data. It is impossible to hack all the nodes at the same time. Even if
the hacker attempts to, the neighbouring nodes would invalidate.
Because the ownership of Blockchain can be decentralized, no central authority can take control;
rather, all transactions are validated in the Blockchain network using the inbuilt consensus
mechanism.
We can also classify blockchains as Public and Private on the basis of access to data that they have
on Blockchain.
Public Blockchains
In public blockchains no one controls information on the blockchain or the laws of the blockchain.
Information on blockchain is totally transparent as it is accessible to all network members. No
member can alter the protocols of the blockchain unless approved by other network members. It is
open to everyone and anyone who wants to transact/verify as part of the network.

Famous Public Blockchains:
Bitcoin Blockchain
Bitcoin is an example of public blockchain as it uses a blockchain on which bitcoin cryptocurrency
works. It is the first decentralized digital currency. Bitcoin was invented by an unknown person or
group of people under the name Satoshi and released as open-source software in 2009.
Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority or banks; managing

transactions and the issuing of bitcoins is carried out collectively by the network. Bitcoin is open-
source; its design is public, nobody owns or controls Bitcoin and everyone can take part. Through

many of its unique properties, Bitcoin allows exciting uses that could not be covered by any previous
payment system. [2]
Ethereum Blockchain
Ethereum is another famous blockchain with its own digital currency ether. It is a powerful platform
for developers and innovators to create a diverse array of distributed applications called DApps.
Ethereum introduced the concept of “smart contracts”. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts
residing on the blockchain where the terms of the agreement between buyers and sellers are
directly written into lines of code. [3]
Bitcoin and Ethereum are two leading public blockchains. There are lots of others like NEM, Waves,
NEO, Litecoin and Dash. In the future, there are likely to be many simultaneously functioning digital
currencies, tokens and blockchains.
NEM Blockchain
NEM Blockchain has evolved to be one of the best platforms to deploy custom tokens. In addition,
implementing the latest developments has allowed NEM to increase network capacity and is scalable
as they use Proof of Importance (POI), an enhancement to the Proof of Stake(PoS), for consensus
which leads to reduced transaction times and increased transaction throughput. This is a huge
benefit as compared to Ethereum given the scalability issues Ethereum has.
NEM also has a large thriving community that includes entrepreneurs, businesses and service
providers, investors, developers, marketing and social media experts, holders, traders, and more —
all of whom want to see the platform succeed. [4]

Private Blockchains
Private blockchains are blockchains which are managed by an organization. Private Blockchains are
permissioned and accessible to only those entities who have been granted the permission by the
organization.
Famous Private Blockchains:
Hyperledger : Blockchain Technologies for Business
The Hyperledger Project, by the Linux Foundation, works to develop open protocols and standards in
blockchain technology for enterprise use. Hyperledger incubates and promotes a range of business
blockchain technologies, including distributed ledger frameworks, smart contract engines, client

libraries, graphical interfaces, utility libraries and sample applications. The Hyperledger umbrella
strategy encourages the re-use of common building blocks and enables rapid innovation of DLT
components. [5]
In December 2015, the Linux Foundation announced the creation of the Hyperledger Project.
Early members of Hyperledger included blockchain ISVs, (Blockchain, ConsenSys, Digital Asset, R3,
Onchain), well-known technology platform companies (Cisco, Fujitsu, Hitachi, IBM, Intel, NEC, NTT
DATA, Red Hat, VMware), financial services firms (ABN AMRO, ANZ Bank, BNY Mellon, CLS Group,
CME Group, the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), Deutsche Börse Group, J.P.
Morgan, State Street, SWIFT, Wells Fargo), Business Software companies like SAP, Systems
integrators and others such as: (Accenture, Calastone,Wipro, Credits, Guardtime, IntellectEU, Nxt
Foundation, Symbiont).
The future with Blockchain
Blockchain has the power to rewrite the economic power grid of the traditional order of things and
resolve some of the world’s most difficult problems. [6]
Its technology can provide power to the masses. It can impact individuals, businesses and societies in
innumerable ways.
With blockchain, we can imagine a world where contracts are incorporated in digital code and stored
in transparent, shared databases, where they are protected from deletion, tampering, and revision.
In this world every agreement, every process, every task, and every payment would have a digital
record and signatures that can be identified, validated, stored, and shared. Intermediaries like
lawyers, brokers, and bankers will no longer be necessary. Individuals, organisations, machines and
algorithms would transact freely and the system would be seamlessly frictionless. Everything is
streamlined.
This is the potential of blockchain.
Permissioned enterprise DLT applications are a natural next step for companies. We’re seeing a lot
of investments in private blockchain networks right now, and the projects involved seem poised for
real short-term impact. Organizations can also tackle specific problems in transactions across
boundaries with localized applications.
Blockchain is the foundational technology: It has the potential to create new foundations for our
economic and social systems.
Here for the Long Term
Blockchain technology is still in an early, formative stage, and cryptocurrencies are only its first
major use case. Beyond cryptocurrency, blockchain technology will change how we transact, record
and verify transactions. This will revolutionise contracts and reduce friction in the exchange of
assets. Over the next few decades, blockchain technology will seep through our organisations, and
shape how we transact with one another.
There are countries like Estonia and Dubai that are planning to shift governance onto Blockchain
already. [7] [8] The logical extension to this is projected in the future and entire human race can be
self-governed through DLT.
Just as the Internet continues to power emergent technologies, we can expect to see new use cases
of blockchain technology across all industries.

MBit – Using the power of DAO
The MBit ecosystem
MBit strongly believes in the power of blockchain technology and the radical change it can bring to
existing business models. We are currently focusing on 4 key endeavours to generate value using
blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies.

Endeavours

I. Blockchain Applications
Customer loyalty and engagement can make or break businesses, and as such, loyalty
rewards programs represent strategic investments for all types of business. We assume that
you and possibly every adult you know is enrolled in some form of loyalty program.
Therefore, MBit is planning to develop a blockchain application to cater the loyalty sector.
Please refer to section 4 below for more details.
II. Education
While Bitcoin has caught the fancy of the masses due to its volatile increase of value. But
very few truly understand the blockchain technology which powers Bitcoin and other
cryptocurrencies. This leaves a lot of investors exposed to risk as investing in something
while lacking important information lead to losses. MBit understands this and therefore
wants to educate the public with proper facts and information regarding blockchain and
cryptocurrency space. Therefore, MBit will be hosting various events and seminars to
achieve this. Participants will be charged a nominal fee to participate in such events

MBit – A Decentralised Organisation (DO)
The team behind Mbit understands the power of the masses in bringing about economic change.
This is the same power which fuels direct marketing and will propel Mbit to succeed. This means all
members of the Mbit ecosystem are extremely important for success. The trust which MBit
members place in the ecosystem is what will help MBit succeed. Mbit ecosystem is therefore
designed in a manner which rewards its members for placing their valuable trust in Mbit. Because
trust in the MBit system equates to ownership. This is means that whoever is a member of the MBit

ecosystem and trusts Mbit, automatically becomes an owner and can enjoy the profits of the
organisation.

More trust == More Investment == More Ownership == More Profit
This organisation model can be implemented using blockchain and is referred as Decentralised
Organisation or DO.
Like a traditional company, the DO is built for profit. It is seeded via the sale of ‘DO tokens’, in MBit’s
Case – MBIT Classic Coin (MCC), during the crowdfunding period. The percentage of MBIT Classic
Coin owned defines the percentage of profit which will be shared with the MBIT Classic Coin holder.
MBIT Classic Coin can be compared to ‘company equity’ and MBIT Classic Coin holders to ‘equity
holders’ in traditional business terms. While this may not be as direct a comparison in absolute
terms, it helps to contextualize and understand the terms in a business perspective.

Token Technology
We will be using NEM Blockchain to deploy MCC. MCC tokens can be issued, transferred, swapped
and traded directly using the NEM blockchain. It’s a powerful, quick, scalable platform that
prioritises the user and offers powerful tools for developers.
The benefits of Mbit
Profits earned from all projects distributed as per percentage of MCC owned.
• Coins represent profit percentage
• Coin Holders will receive percentage of company profit
▪ Total supply of coins – 1000 coins
▪ Sam owns 100 coins
▪ Company profit: Rs. 500
▪ Sam owns 10% of total MCC
▪ Sam gets Rs. 50 profit (10% of Rs. 500 profit)
• Profits from all MBit Ecosystem endeavours will be covered.

ROYYAL– The Decentralised Hyperlocal Loyalty Token
Introduction
Blockchain has the potential to revolutionise customer loyalty market through a universal,
omnichannel loyalty ecosystem. Given the control it provides to its data privacy Blockchain can be
used to run secure hyperlocal marketing campaigns. Thanks to the transparency and trust blockchain
technology provides in creating an ecosystem where any merchant can join and run hyperlocal and
loyalty programs. This means a win-win scenario is created where customers and merchants can
truly enjoy the potential of brand, hyperlocal marketing and loyalty.

Market Opportunity
Hyperlocal Segment in India
"Hyperlocal marketing" is marketing to a specific local geographic location, typically a small area
such as a district, city, locality, zip code or even a block. As per Ken Research’s research, the Indian
Hyperlocal market will increase at a significant CAGR rate and will exceed Rs. 2,306 Cr. by 2020. [9]
Growing urbanisation, personalised custom requirements along with capability of reviewing
products that appeal to the aesthetic sensibilities or aspirational desires of the person will lead to
the rise in the Hyperlocal market in India. One of the key segment who can benefit from hyper local
segment is the unorganised retail market in India.
Retailing in India is mostly unorganized. According to a survey by AT Kearney, a sizable percentage of
the Rs. 400,000 crore retail markets are unorganized in India. Also, only a Rs. 20,000 crore segment
of the market is organized. [10] The segment is highly fragmented with 97% of its business being run
by the unorganized retailers such as traditional family run stores and kirana stores. This sector is the
biggest source of employment after agriculture. It also has a deep penetration into rural India and
generates more than 10% of India’s GDP. Unorganized retailers consist of the local kirana stores,
chemists, footwear shops, apparel shops, paan and beedi shops, hand-cart hawkers, pavement
vendors, etc. Retailing in the unorganized sector is not a profit-oriented venture but just a source of
livelihood. Therefore, the capital investment is very low, and the infrastructure is rudimentary.
Given the limitations in capital, the unorganised retail sector in India is unable to invest in the latest
technology which can help them in deploying hyperlocal marketing. If the unorganised retail sector
gets access to current technology such as CRM Services, PoS Digital Billing Systems at low cost they
can increase revenue and decrease cost which leads to increased profits. These systems will also
help these merchants to advertise to their hyper local audience basis location and market
themselves.
Loyalty Segment in India
Research findings showcase that the cost to acquire a new customer is up to five times more than
retaining an existing customer. Also, a 5% decrease in customer defection rate can increase profits
by 25% to 85% basis on the business sector. [11]

Big brands recognize this and as the share of organized retail sector grows, such loyalty programs are
becoming more prevalent. Also, loyalty works as a crucial relationship tool and is now an important
practice among Indian retailers especially organized ones. Today, all big retail chains like Pantaloons,
Westside, Shoppers stop, Big Bazaar etc. have loyalty programs.
No wonder the market potential of loyalty sector in India is poised at Rs 8,500 crore today. [12]
MBit is therefore enabling the unorganised retail sector to deploy hyperlocal marketing and loyalty
program through a blockchain solution. MBit will work towards helping unorganized merchants to
organize themselves by using CRM, POS software and enjoy the power of hyperlocal marketing and
loyalty programs using the ROYYAL Blockchain Application.
The power of CRM
Customer Relationship Management (CRM) is all of the activities, strategies and technologies that
companies use to manage their interactions with their current and potential customers. A saying
frequently heard and said in many businesses is "customer is king."

- Forbes [13]

CRM helps organisations to develop a connection with their customers that helps in creating loyalty
and customer retention. Customer loyalty is an aspect that affect a company's revenue. Therefore,
CRM is an approach that leads to increased profits for a business. Fundamentally, a CRM tool has a
user interface for collecting customer data that helps organisations identify and connect with
customers in a scalable way.
Unorganised retailers willing to retain customers through CRM do not have a cost-effective solution
to reach them or to manage their data. Using a CRM solution will help retailers to:
• Know clients better by saving customer details & interactions on a database.
• Increase Sales by Running and Managing marketing / promotional campaigns among
prospective customers
• Keep the data secured and private
• Keep your customers informed and updated
• Bring back the lost customers
Therefore, MBit is providing a loyalty program and hyperlocal marketing utilizing a strong CRM
solution which will be secured using Blockchain Technology.
Loyalty Sector Status Quo
A lot of consumers and organisations globally are enjoying the benefits of customer loyalty
programs. Retail loyalty programs are a hit in Asia, where seven in ten customers with Internet
access are part of one or more loyalty programs, global survey company Nielsen noted. [14]
Despite the progress in loyalty program involvement, various issues have stopped these programs
from realizing their full potential. Top concerns include low redemption rates, high operational costs,
account inactivity and other logistical concerns as hindrances to improving customer loyalty. [15]
Loyalty programs need to cater to these issues and focus on consumer preference. As per a Nielsen
study, the most appreciated rewards in loyalty programs are monetary. [16] Therefore, such programs
must focus their most redeeming features moving forward. Worldwide, loyalty program participants
also value flexibility in receiving rewards, irrespective of channels and options of rewards to redeem.

In summary, the current loyalty economy has coordination problems with unrealized rewards, and
customers are desiring more flexibility and monetary benefits. In the Loyalty Ecosystem of the
future, consumers need to get exactly what they want, and pain points must be eliminated.
Achieving the potential of loyalty through Blockchain
Using Blockchain as a distributed ledger allows participating entities, which in the case of loyalty
rewards programs include loyalty reward program providers, administrators, system managers,
customers, etc. to intersect and cooperate in single ecosystem without middlemen and without
conceding privacy or competition.
For loyalty rewards program providers, we also believe that blockchain has the potential to
streamline execution and administration of their programs with near-real-time transparency,
resulting in cost savings that can be realized in the medium term. For small businesses, an
intertwined system provides them unparalleled scale.
Finally, blockchain can interact with existing loyalty rewards program platforms through smart
contracts, which are “self-executing code on a blockchain that automatically implements the terms
of an agreement between parties,” and associated digital architecture.
Achieving the potential of hyperlocal marketing through Blockchain
Using Blockchain allows participating merchants to run hyperlocal marketing programs to potential
customers without compromising user privacy. This is because sensitive user data will be
permissioned and can be accessible only by self or brands where the self redeems tokens.
Merchants can define their target audience basis geography and broad demographics and also
target existing customers to run hyperlocal marketing and showcase various offers on the MBit User
App.
ROYYAL – A decentralized loyalty ecosystem
A peek into the ROYYAL ecosystem
The ROYYAL ecosystem facilitates brands, merchants and customers to enjoy the full potential of
loyalty programs using Blockchain Technology. Blockchain will ensure that all participating entities
can function transparently and securely to ensure total trust.
All participating merchants can provide ROYYAL loyalty tokens to customers. Customers can redeem
these tokens with the same merchant or any other merchant who is a member of the ROYYAL
ecosystem. This directly helps in increased redemption rates of loyalty tokens as users are now no
longer bound by avenues where they can use their loyalty tokens. Users can transfer loyalty tokens
to other users as well.
Merchants will benefit from this primarily as they can start their loyalty program without any costs
associated with it other than the benefits they are providing for the loyalty tokens. The additional
benefit is that they can get more loyalty tokens redeemed at their outlet by providing fantastic
service and products. Therefore, such stores which provide excellent quality of service and products
need not be worried of “losing” their tokens to other customers as they can instead “gain” additional
tokens from other merchants.
MBit will be providing CRM and POS software to participating merchants and an app with token
wallet to consumers. This software will be interacting with the underlying blockchain layer ensuring
that all transactions are carried out systematically.

Token mechanics
ROYYAL will be based on the NEM Blockchain platform. This will have a stable price point as ROYYAL
token can only be used in its own ecosystem and cannot be traded with any other currency i.e.
ROYYAL can be used only for trading goods and service on the MBit ecosystem.
All participating merchants will purchase ROYYAL through the POS application during sales and then
provide it to customers. This will help merchants to avoid accounting liability for the tokens. The
amount of loyalty tokens purchased and provided will be basis the criteria the merchant has fed into
the POS. One such parameter will be ticket size of the purchase.
Users can now redeem these ROYYAL tokens with the same merchant, other merchant or even
transfer it to friends and family.



ROYYAL in real life - applications and use cases
The real-life use case of ROYYAL can be best described using an example. Consider a customer
named Sam. Sam purchases products and avails services at various outlets in his local community.
He buys his groceries weekly from a small supermarket close to his house. Since the supermarket is a
part of the ROYYAL ecosystem Sam gets ROYYAL tokens on each purchase. Sam redeems most of
these tokens back at the supermarket as he loves the convenience, quality and service of the
supermarket. Also, he is getting a good discount by redeeming his ROYYAL tokens during purchase.
Once every few months, Sam also purchases clothing. He has a few outlets in mind for the purchase.
Sam is aware that he still has quite a few ROYYAL in his wallet. Sam uses the ROYYAL app to identify
cloth stores who accept ROYYAL tokens. Basis the reviews and feedback of other customers Sam
visits 2 stores and finally purchases from one of them. He redeems a few ROYYAL tokens and gets a
good discount on his first purchase as well as receives additional token from the clothing store. The
clothing store ends up acquiring a new customer.
Sam’s brother, John, is a gadget freak. He is always on the lookout to add new interesting gadgets to
his collection. John is also a member of the ROYYAL ecosystem and purchases most of his gadgets at
an electronic store. Given that John has redeemed most of his ROYYAL token he requests his brother
Sam to share some tokens. Sam transfers ROYYAL to John using the app and John redeems them to
get a good discount.

The benefits of ROYYAL
The primary benefit for ROYYAL is its fungibility. In economics, fungibility is the property of a good or
a commodity whose individual units are essentially interchangeable. This means customers will be
empowered to use ROYYAL tokens across multiple retailers in various sectors.
Businesses will be benefited by achieving the full potential of loyalty programs. They will enjoy
massive cost savings using ROYYAL as they don’t have to invest in developing and maintaining their
own loyalty programs. This cost benefit can be directly passed on to the customers as a part of the
loyalty program. Businesses will also stand to gain new loyal customers through this ecosystem. This
ecosystem will provide an equal footing for all businesses to cooperate as partners to focusing on
customer service and thus maximise individual profits.
Blockchain Market Opportunities
Current developments show that many use cases that are comparatively simple to design and
implement are appearing. Visa has partnered with blockchain company Chain to build Visa B2B
Connect, an enterprise blockchain infrastructure to facilitate international financial transactions for
their corporate clients. [16]
Big -house financial institutions are moving towards using blockchain for intra-organizational
projects to reduce organizational complexity, improve efficiency, and reduce costs. Banks and major
financial institutions are working both collaboratively and independently to develop blockchain
technology. [17]
New emerging markets, despite getting a subsequent start on blockchain than the Western parts of
the globe, have been catching up, with strong performances in 2016–17, particularly in Asia.
The recent blooming of venture capital industry also indicates that the fintech is mobilising around
the potential impact of blockchain on their business, and is beginning to invest in related research
development and testing its applications. Investments in companies specialising in Blockchain &
Cryptocurrencies increased YoY at a 14.2% CAGR between 2014 and 2016. 2017 has been
particularly successful for the sector with $1.4bn worth of investment.
[18]

The newly launched (February 2017) Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) aims to leverage large
corporate investments in the private Ethereum blockchain, bringing together Fortune 500
companies, start-ups, and other stakeholders. [19]
Interest in comparing alternatives to blockchain is also great, evidenced by broad industry
participation to the R3 consortium, an alternative distributed consensus ledger. This group has
grown to include more than 70 global banks [20] Ripple, which proposes a blockchain-like technology
and network for faster settlement of payments around the globe, has more than 75 banking clients
globally. [21]
On a broader scale, a Market and Markets report states that the blockchain market size is expected
to grow from USD 241.9 Million in 2016 to USD 7,683.7 Million by 2022, at a Compound Annual
Growth Rate (CAGR) of 79.6%. [22]

In other words, there’s room for plenty of opportunities for

investors to benefit from in this exciting–and expanding–market.

The banking and finance industries aren’t the only ones adopting blockchain technology. For
example, it has been used in securing elections, and big companies involved in supply chain,
healthcare are also making the leap into blockchain [23] [24] [25]
.

Putting it simply, there’s a wealth of opportunity to be had in the blockchain industry, and it’s only
getting started.
